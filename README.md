# eregold

Behold! The mighty dwarves of The Kingdom of Erebor now provide banking services!

## Goal

Goal of this project is to create different versions of the same application, **Eregold**. Each version will increase in complexity, from simple frontend -> backend -> db application, to a microservices one, which will hopefully help new developers understand all the layers of modern web applications.

## Functionality

**Eregold** will be very simplified banking application, where user can:
- register
- login
- request a new account
- make a transfer between own accounts
- make a deposit
